#Project Description

  This project we had to create a company landing page using semantic html and css.
  We need to keep track of progress on Github and lastly, we need to deploy the
  site. Link for my deployed website => [text goes here](url goes here)

#About my project

  The hardest part of creating a project like this is coming up with a company
  from thin air. To solve that problem, I used a already "existing" company. I
  chose Aviato (ahh-vee-ahh-t≈ç), a social media aggregation and management software
  for commercial airlines, created by Erlich Bachman on the show Silicon Valley.
